# Deepfake Generation Using First Order Model
This repository provides a guide on how to create deepfakes using the First Order Model. The First Order Model is an exciting deep learning technique that enables the manipulation and animation of facial expressions in videos. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the environment, loading the necessary checkpoints, and generating deepfake videos.
# Credit
The code and inspiration for this project come from the repository AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model. The original repository provides the core implementation of the First Order Model and serves as the foundation for this guide. This code modifies the old_demo.ipynb.
# Tools 
This program runs on python3.
